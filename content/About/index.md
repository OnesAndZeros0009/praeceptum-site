# Praeceptum — A Game of Magic and Alchemy


**Praeceptum** is a 2D game built on a custom engine written in C++.

In Latin, *praeceptum* means “a rule” or “a teaching.” This reflects the nature of the game: a world where, guided by the teachings of magi, you experiment with the magical elements of a fully simulated world to achieve greater knowledge and power.

Praeceptum stands out as a game driven by **player discovery**. Whether you’re crafting intricate spells from a procedurally generated magical language or experimenting with complex alchemical reactions, you’ll uncover the hidden rules of magic and matter.

It’s a game about learning, creativity, and becoming a true magus who understands the inner workings of a vibrant simulated world.
